# Webhook Server Project Structure

This is what your webhook server project would look like:

```
my_whatsapp_webhook_server/
├── pubspec.yaml                    # Dependencies for webhook server
├── webhook_server.dart             # Main webhook server code
├── Dockerfile                      # For cloud deployment
├── docker-compose.yml             # For local testing
└── .env                           # Environment variables

Dependencies in pubspec.yaml:
```yaml
name: my_whatsapp_webhook_server
description: WhatsApp webhook server using whatsapp_cloud_flutter

environment:
  sdk: '>=3.0.0 <4.0.0'

dependencies:
  shelf: ^1.4.1
  shelf_router: ^1.1.4
  whatsapp_cloud_flutter:
    path: ../whatsapp_cloud_flutter  # Your package
    # OR from pub.dev: ^1.0.0

dev_dependencies:
  lints: ^2.1.0
```

## How it works:

1. **Your Flutter Package** provides:
   - WebhookService class (parsing utilities)
   - MessageEvent, StatusEvent classes
   - WhatsAppCloudClient for sending messages

2. **Your Webhook Server** (separate project):
   - Uses your package as a dependency
   - Runs on cloud server (Heroku, Google Cloud, etc.)
   - Receives HTTP requests from Meta
   - Uses your package to process and respond

3. **Your Flutter App** (another separate project):
   - Uses your package as a dependency
   - Sends messages via WhatsAppCloudClient
   - Can connect to webhook server via WebSocket for real-time updates
